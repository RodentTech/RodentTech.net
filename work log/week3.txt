Today I have started to build the cache part for the database. The initial algorithm I plan to use is LFU(Least Recently Used), which means whenever I need to extract a random element from the database, or push an element into the reading queue, I would choose by LFU. However, this LFU still has some problems and there still exists some better solutions. I will continue studying and working on it tomorrow.

Today I implemented another idea of database cache, which is LRU(Least Recently Uses). Using LRU, this is to extract the random element when there the data there is too large and we cannot get the data fast enough within O(n) time. Because for a predictable future, we might need to be ready for it.

Today I uploaded some simple change to the LRU, including some comments and some codestyle. For the rest days of this week, I will try to make this version better and more stable under high request per second.
