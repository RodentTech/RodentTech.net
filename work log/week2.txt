This is a very hard day for me because I just knew that my SSN application has been pending. Maybe it will be one month or even later. So in this case, Yiqing and me both need to be careful about our tax. In the building and working period in Rodent Tech LLC, we want to make sure that everything can follow the legal procedures and we can pay our taxes in time. 
The current job is to choose a plan to fulfill our website and start creating our working formula, such as knowledge, customer range and expected investment from external source(if we can really make it strong and large enough).
