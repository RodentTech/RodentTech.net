This is a very hard day for me because I just knew that my SSN application has been pending. Maybe it will be one month or even later. So in this case, Yiqing and me both need to be careful about our tax. In the building and working period in Rodent Tech LLC, we want to make sure that everything can follow the legal procedures and we can pay our taxes in time. 
The current job is to choose a plan to fulfill our website and start creating our working formula, such as knowledge, customer range and expected investment from external source(if we can really make it strong and large enough).

I have been checking and searching for resources of website templates. The Wix seems just fine, and its price seems acceptable. However, it seems there still exists some issues for me to access the website from Zenbusiness, maybe because of the authority issues. So what I am going to do now is to contact Zenbusiness's server and try to solve this problem and then build this website by myself or using a template, which depends on the team. 
And also we just formally enabled our business bank account and there is 900$ inside. We do not want to pay for the execution fee but the lowest amount of deposit to absolve is quite large, so the final amount is just 900$.
