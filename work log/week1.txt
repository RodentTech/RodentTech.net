Today we were busy with the business license, about to consult the lawyer at 8:30pm regarding the BE-13 and busiess license issues. Also we have made a new business account from Bank of America.
I am planning to start designing the infrastructure of the company website. And I need to decide what technology stacks I should use. Till now, what I believe that I need is Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Hibernate and RabbitMQ.
For building a local github repository, we need to first use git init, then use git clone, and then git fetch to build the connections between local side and github side. And so is done.
